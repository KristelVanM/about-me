            <p>The starting point of Eco's theory is the fact that, in both industrialized and nature-based
                civilizations, human beings are evolving in a "system of systems of signs". Drawing much of his
                inspiration from the work of Peirce, he developed his theory of the sign in 1973, and went on to revise
                it in 1988. A distinguishing feature of Eco's theory is that in addition to words and language, it also
                addresses non-linguistic and even natural signs, which do signify, based on a code, or previous
                learning. </p>
